There are many energy devices in the industry garden.Please see the photo SCADA1.png in the project.
A simulation model system for energy devices data analysis was setted.  
The mtcurve project was developed in VS2013+QT and was a part of the model system .
Some professional formulas were used to get results for making real-time and history curves. Each device has one curve. 
Collecting million data from the real-time databse and cloud to creat curves.
